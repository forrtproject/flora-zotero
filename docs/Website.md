# Zotero Replication Checker
A privacy-first Zotero 7 plugin that discovers replication studies for items in your library using the [FORRT Library of Reproduction and Replication Attempts (FLoRA)](). It scans your local library for DOIs, checks against FLoRA using privacy-preserving prefix matching, notifies you when reproductions and replications exist, and allows easy addition to your library — all without sending identifiable data off your machine.

This plugin was developed as a [FORRT](https://forrt.org/) project to build a working prototype for the open science community. It helps researchers discover replication studies by identifying items with known replications and unobtrusively notifying them via tags and notes.  

## Features

- 🔍 **Privacy-preserving matching**: Uses hash prefixes to query the database without exposing your library contents
- 📚 **Batch processing**: Checks entire library, selected items, or collections in one operation
- 📖 **Read-only library support**: Automatically detects read-only group libraries and offers to copy originals and replications to your Personal library
- 🏷️ **Automatic tagging**: Adds contextual tags including "Has Replication", "Is Replication", and "Original present in Read-Only Library"
- 📝 **Detailed notes**: Creates child notes with replication details (title, authors, journal, outcome, DOI)
- 🔗 **Smart organization**: Creates separate collections for originals from read-only libraries and their replications
- 🔄 **Bidirectional linking**: Automatically links original studies with their replications as related items
- 🚫 **Blacklist management**: Ban unwanted replications from being re-added during future checks
- 🌍 **Multi-language support**: Available in English and German, with easy localization for additional languages
- ⚡ **Fast**: Efficient hash-based lookup with collision handling.
