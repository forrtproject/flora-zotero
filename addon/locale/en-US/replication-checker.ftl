## Onboarding
onboarding-welcome-title = Welcome to Replication Checker!
onboarding-welcome-content =
    Thank you for installing the Zotero Replication Checker!

    This plugin helps you discover replication and reproduction studies by automatically checking your library items against the FORRT Literature Database (FLoRA).

    ✨ Key Features:
    • Checks entire library, collections, or individual items
    • Detects both replications and computational reproductions
    • Handles articles with multiple original studies
    • Adds outcome-tagged notes with DOI links
    • Automatically tags items (e.g. "Has Replication", "Is Replication")
    • Offers to add the original study when a replication is detected
    • Read-only group library support — copies items to Personal library
    • Configurable folder names for replications and reproductions
    • Ban unwanted replications from future checks
    • Auto-check: scans new items automatically or on a schedule
    • Privacy-preserving: your DOIs are never sent to the server
    • Available in multiple languages

    Let's take a quick tour to get you started!

onboarding-tools-title = Check Your Entire Library
onboarding-tools-content =

    🔍 What it does:
    • Scans all items with DOIs
    • Queries FLoRA database
    • Creates notes with details
    • Tags items by outcome

    💡 Tip: Takes a few minutes depending on library size.
